                        The response must be only in pure json structure, with some items inside the main 'recon' field, representing the tool 'name', brief 'description' and 'command' used to run the tool. Do not answer with any other format because the response will be parsed by an automated system.
                        When the tool is not installed by default in Kali Linux, include the field 'install' with the bash command to install the tool or auxiliary files in the command like wordlists or scripts.  
                        Be very strict with the response format, it is pure json with no formatting, no markdown, and do not include any additional information or comments.
