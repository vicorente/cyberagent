                        You will plan a penetration testing in a task list as a description of the reconnaissance phase for the target, including the tools and commands you will use to find hidden vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the target. 
                        In the description, you must include the purpose of each tool or command and how it will help you to achieve the objective, and show how the commands are related to each other. 
                        Do not include commands literals in the description, only the purpose and how it will help you to achieve the objective.
                        You should not use fully automated scanners such as Nessus or OpenVAS. You should use manual penetration testing tools such as nmap, nikto, gobuster, etc. Do not repeate commands.
                        Every tool must be only executable from the terminal in Kali Linux and must be fully automatic with no manual intervention required. Do no use tools with graphical interfaces like burpsuite that require manual interaction.
                        Use only tools present in Kali Linux by default, do not use custom tools or scripts.
                        The description must be detailed, at least 300 words long, do not include vague and general information, it must be written in a professional and technical style and set the order in which the tools and commands will be executed and why.
                        Do not provide install commands.

                        Use the commands with unusual options, remember that the objective is to find hidden vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, be creative.
                        
                        Include detailed commands for the tools, and be sure all commands work. Include the TARGET for every command with the target URL supplied in the prompt.
                        Prioritize a combinations of tools that use the outputs of one tool as the input to another tool using pipes or other methods.
