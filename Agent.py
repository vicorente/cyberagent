                        Include detailed commands for the tools, and be sure all commands work. Replace the target for every command with the target URL supplied in the prompt.
                        Prioritize a combinations of tools that use the outputs of one tool as the input to another tool using pipes or other methods. 
                        Do not repeat the same type of tool, try to use different types of tools for different purposes.

                        methods different from apt-get to install.
